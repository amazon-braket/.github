# Welcome to the Amazon Braket GitHub organization
[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is a fully managed service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) helping researchers, scientists, and developers get started with quantum computing without having to worry about setting up cloud infrastructure. 

Quantum computing has the potential to solve computational problems beyond the reach of classical computers because it harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to process information in new ways. 

A number of open-source projects have been built on top of Amazon Braket. On this page you find starting point to discover these artifacts and how you can contribute to our quantum computing community! 

# Amazon Braket fully supported repositories
We aim to respond within a few days for PRs and Issues raised in fully supported GitHub repositories. Customers can find these repositories installed on Amazon Braket Notebook Instances or on AWS managed containers for [Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-use.html).

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
* Does code written for Braket have to use the Amazon Braket Python SDK?
  * No, Braket offers simple APIs for a range of programming languages (C++, JavaScript, and more). The Braket service also accepts OpenQASM 3 as the payload for quantum devices. The benefit of integrating with the Amazon Braket Python SDK is that the Python package provides convenience methods for building OpenQASM programs (such as a circuit class) as well as integrations with AWS sessions. We also offer an experimental version of [the Amazon Braket SDK in Julia](https://github.com/amazon-braket/Braket.jl).
* What are [Braket Schemas](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-schemas-python) and how would I use them?
  * Braket schemas are contracts between the end user and the Braket cloud service that allow you to programmatically construct and verify the request payloads being sent to Braket and the the response payloads generated by Braket. Without clearly defined schemas, you would have to guess or figure out by trial and error what structure the request/response payloads have. The schemas are for instance used by the Braket Python SDK. For more information on using Braket schemas see https://amazon-braket-schemas-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
* What are [Braket Containers](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-containers) and why do they matter? 
    * Braket containers are Docker containers that define the runtime environment for an Amazon Braket hybrid job. They allow you to run custom code as part of a co-processing hybrid jobs between a CPU or QPU and a quantum device. AWS [supports a fixed set of containers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-script-environment.html) and provides regular software updates for feature and security reasons. Minor adjustments to the runtime environment can be done by using the Braket base container and adding [a requirements.txt file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-hybrid-job-decorator.html#install-python-packages-and-code). If the runtime environment is very different from what Braket containers offer you can [bring your own container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-byoc.html).
* Is it a requirement to have an AWS account to contribute or to make use of the Amazon Braket repositories?
  * You may find the repositories useful without an AWS account but will need an AWS account to actually use the repositories to run on quantum computing hardware. As stand-alone you can for instance use the Amazon Braket SDK to construct quantum circuits and translate them to OpenQASM 3 (see [example](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-examples/blob/main/examples/braket_features/Getting_Started_with_OpenQASM_on_Braket.ipynb)). It is also possible to develop minor code contributions for the repositories without an AWS account but in most cases we recommend you use an account.
